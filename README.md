This project is creating a professional webpage usnig boot strap
i was able to get most of the elements needed for the project from bootstrap and W3school
i first created the home page which ic the index page, then i created all of the other navigational page such as about, portfolio, and contact. 
i was able to find navigational layout and all of the contect needed for the project from boot strap
the most difficult part of this project was creating the layout
once the layout was created everything else just flowed
i learned the most from this project so far.
